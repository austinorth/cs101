# CS 101

This repo contains basic computer science lessons. Lessons are organized into
modules. Each module is contained within a subdirectory of this repo. Modules
do not necessarily correspond to a single lecture/class (I don't have that kind
of planning/foresight).

These courses aim to be interactive. The goal is for the modules to serve as an
outline and/or jumping-off point for discussion and investigation. Hopefully
conversation and curiosity take over and lead us down paths that are most
interesting to the participants.

Each module starts with familiar concepts (hopefully), and then dives deeper
into the hows/whys of the computer science fundamentals that support them.

I expect participants to have a basic understanding and familiarity with
computers, but all skill levels are welcome. These lessons will be most
beneficial if you bring your own computer and try things yourself. Some
lessons will be more focused on Linux than other operating systems, but the
concepts should translate.
